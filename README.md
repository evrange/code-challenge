# EV Range â€” Code Challenge

Thank you for applying to join EV Range.

As part of our recruitment process, we would like you to complete a short technical task that will
help us to assess your ability to turn requirements to solutions, your approach to problem solving
and the quality of your delivery.

## Installation

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account

2. Clone your forked repository locally and install the dependencies:

    _You will need to have NodeJS 16+ and Yarn installed first_

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Requirements

The repository includes several unit tests which can be run by invoking:

```bash
yarn test
```

You will notice that all the tests are failing. Your task is to add the missing pieces so that all
the tests pass.

You may modify as much of the code, architecture or even dependencies you feel necessary. The only
rule is that **you must not modify the contents of the `test` folder**.

Please limit yourself to a **maximum of two hours**. If you need to more time, stop... your solution
may exceed our expectations and we'd love to discuss what you have so far.

Once ready, please share your solution with us so that we can review it together.
